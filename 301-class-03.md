## 2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

* adding items into arrays
* combining arrays or objects
* spreading an array

## 3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
<br>
const moreNumbers = [...numbers];
<br>
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
<br>
fruits[0] = '7'
<br>
console.log(...[...numbers,'...',...moreNumbers]) //  7 2 3 4 5 ... 1 2 3 4 5

## 4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
<br>
function sum(a, b, c) {
	<br>
  return a + b + c;
}
<br>
console.log(sum(...numbers));
<br>
// expected output: 6
<br>
console.log(sum(numbers));
<br>
// expected output: 1,2,3undefinedundefined
<br>

## 5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
<br>
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
<br>
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
<br>
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
<br>
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
<br>
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
