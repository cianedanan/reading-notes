# Passing Functions as Props

## 1. What does .map() return?

map() returns a new array based on the expression used.

## 2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

Identical to normal JS.

## 3. Each list item needs a unique ____.

## 1. What is the spread operator?

The spread operator "expands an iterable obeject into the list of arguments."

## 2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

* adding items into arrays
* combining arrays or objects
* spreading an array 
* Using math functions

## 3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```JavaScript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const moreNumbers = [...numbers];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
fruits[0] = '7'
console.log(...[...numbers,'...',...moreNumbers]) //  7 2 3 4 5 ... 1 2 3 4 5
```

## 4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```JavaScript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

function sum(a, b, c) {

  return a + b + c;
}

console.log(sum(...numbers));

// expected output: 6

console.log(sum(numbers));
// expected output: 1,2,3undefinedundefined
```

## 5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```JavaScript
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

## 1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

Creates the function in the parent component then passes the variables down in the tag of the child component. 

## 2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?

Loops through the people array and then finds and updates the count on the correct name.

## 3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

By using the this. keyword in tag of the child component.

## 4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

By using this.props.METHODNAME and this.props.ARGUMENT.
