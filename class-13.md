Storing local information can be useful when apps need to be restored automatically. 

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

	So the state of the application will be restored when reopening the webpage.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

	Passwords or personal information should not be stored.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Only strings can be stored into local storage. Using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() can convert things into strings.
