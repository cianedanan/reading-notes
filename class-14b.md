## What Google Learned

Being able to work in a team is essential for any work environment. For a team to function well, the social connection between members has to be strong. During a study that compared different groups on cooperation tasks the groups that were most successful had speaking times that were equally divided between members. The common factor in the unsuccessful groups was that either one person or a collective of the same people were dictating the speaking/leading time. When thoughts and feelings are shared, listened to and validated, a teams ability to work as one is enhanced.
