## Wire Frame and Design

___What is a wireframe?___

Wireframing is the creating a blueprint for a website. Typically hand-drawn first then moved to a software to get a detailed version. 
Depending on the type of project the design process can be like this:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design

Sketch > Code

Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code

Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

Typically high valued projects need elaborate wireframing.

There are plenty of free wireframing tools to choose from, but UXPin, InVision and wirfram.cc are recommended. 

___How to make a wireframe___

1. Research
 
2. Know the priorities
 
3. Map out user flow

4. Keep it simple
 
5. Start testing

6. Prototype

___Three key principles___ 

Clarity

Wireframes answer what the site page is, what can be done, and if it satisfies need. 

Confidence

Keep the site organized. Things should be where you expect them to be.

Simplicity

Keep the site clean. Fluff should be kept at a minimum.

## HTML

HTML is a markup language and is the backbone of a website. Like Markdown, HTML changes the appearance of text and creates links with the use of enclosing tags.

## Semantics

Semantics asks what does this code do? Because of semantics you have an idea of how an element or code will function without it running.
