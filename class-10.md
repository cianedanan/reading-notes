## Debugging

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    Syntax errors are typos in the code vs logic errors which means the code runs but gives the wrong results.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    I had a logical errors with a nested for loop. I stopped coding and planned the steps to get the results I needed. I used console log to help understand what inputs were getting taken in. I had a couples syntax errors that were underlined and made in the problems tab.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

    Running into issues as a software developer is inevitable. Being able to troubleshoot your own code issues and others code is a necessary skill to being proficient in software development.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The debugger tool lets you see the value of variables so you can locate problems occur in your code.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint chokes the code where ever you set it so doesn't run past that point.

3. What is the call stack?

"The call stack shows what code was executed to get to the current line." Displays what function is currently running and what functions are called in that function.
