___How to Add CSS___

The three ways of inserting a style sheet are:

* External CSS.
    * External styles are defined within the link element, inside the head section of an HTML page
    * Can be written in any text editor and must be saved with a .css extension
    * Shouldn't contain any HTML tags

* Internal CSS.
    * An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style
    * The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section

* Inline CSS.
    * Inline may be used to apply unique style for a single element

CSS Priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
