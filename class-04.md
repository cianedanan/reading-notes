## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

Links are necessary for sending the user where they need or want to go. Functions let us reuse a step by step procedure of code. Being able to position page elements precisely is the key to a good webpage layout.

## HTML

    The a element with an href attribute.

2. The href attribute contains what information?

    The href attribute contains the link or url.

3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

  * Rename the link text so its not the URL.
  * Don't rename the link "link."
  * Shorter link texts are better.

## Miscellaneous

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

    One benefit of pair programming is greater efficiency. Errors are easier to prevent or find when more than one programmer is working on the code. Brainstorming for a solution is also quicker. Finishing a code faster would give me more time to work on other non code related tasks.

    Another benefit of pair programming programming is job interview readiness. Many hiring processes pair the interviewee with a current employee to test the interviewees ability to collaborate. You can't land a job with a scuffed interview. Gaining collaboration skills will be necesarry to make sure an interview goes smoothly.
