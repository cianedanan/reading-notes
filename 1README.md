# Reading Notes

## What is this site?

This site is a compilation of all my reading notes. It keeps track of my observations and questions from reading assignments and highlights the knowledge I've obtained from Code 102 all the way to code 401.

## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, there! Iâ€™m Cianenry. Pronounced Shuh-Nen-Ree if you were wondering. I'm a father of two and currently a full-time student at Code Fellows. So far I'm loving it!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a huge nerd with a main interests in video games, anime, fitness and food. Anything shellfish or sushi related is A tier and up on my tier list. I would eat my own weight in shrimp and crab if I were ever given the chance to. I'm not really that interested in fitness. I just wrote that because I go to the gym a couple days a week and ate a salad the other day. Giving piggy back rides to both my kids is also a workout, so I like to think I'm somewhat fit. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite anime of all time. After that in no particular order includes One Punch Man, Parasyte, and Attack on Titan. My favorite game genres include puzzle platformers, competitive fps/mobas, survival games and rpgs. I will play literally anything with the right people though.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
