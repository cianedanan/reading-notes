# Introduction to React and Components

Knowing what a component is and how a component works and the advantage of using components is gives a better understanding on how and when to use them.  

### 1. What is a “component”?

A component is a software object with well-engineered functionality or set of functionality that can be easily reused, replaced, edited and works as a unit in a composition of components.

### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?

* Reusability - Components are typically engineered to be used again for different tasks.  

* Replaceable - Components can be swapped out for other components freely.

* Not context specific - Components are engineered to work in various environments and contexts.

* Extensible - A component can be tweaked from the ancestor component to provide new behaviors.

* Encapsulated - A component can be used without showing the internals.

* Independent - Components are engineered to function without relying on other components.

### 3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

* Ease of deployment - able to upgrade to new versions easily

* Reduced cost - save on resources by not having to create fresh components when third party components exists

* Reusable - can be used repeatedly across applications or systems

* Modification of technical complexity - 

* Reliability - Knowing the component is reliable reinsures the whole system is reliable.

* System maintenance and evolution - Safe to assume updates wont cause conflicts

* Independence - Focus can be solely on the development of the individual component due the flexible nature of components.

### 1. What is “props” short for?

### 2. How are props used in React?

"Props are used for passing data from one component to another."

### 3. What is the flow of props?

The flow is a uni-directional from parent to child.
