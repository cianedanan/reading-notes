_What is Markdown?_

Markdown is a begginer friendly coding language. Using a text editor, you can tweak the appearance of plain text.  

## Headings

At the top of this page is a Heading level 1. It's the largest out of the 6 possible heading markdowns. Putting a # at the start of the line will create this effect. Adding more # before the text will make the header smaller.
