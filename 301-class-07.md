# REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

He helped write the HTTP specification.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Most of the techniques developers used after Fielding and his colleagues started building the web didn't require all machines in the world, only a small group.

3. What does a GET do?

HTTP GET brings back all the resources needed to display a website.

4. What does a POST do?

POST adds something from one system to another system.

5. What does PUT do?

PUT replaces something in a system with something from another system.

6. What does PATCH do?

Patch updates the system.
