__~~Fixed~~ Growth Mindset__

_Having a growth mindset is knowing desired skills and intelligence are obtainable through perserverance. Being born gifted sure can help, but full potential can't be reached without consistant effort._

Reminders for maintaining a __Growth Mindset:__

1. Ask what went well and ask what could have gone better?
2. Roundhouse the instant gratifcation monkey in the forehead
3. Remember Michael Jordan didn't make varsity his sophmore year in highschool
