## Text Editors

___What's a text editor?___

A text editor is an essential tool for programmers that allows them to write and edit code. Website's, programs, video games all start on a text editor. The text editor that you may/currently use was made most likely coded with a text editor. 

___What to look for in a text editor?___

Having code completion, syntax highlighting, themes and wide extension selection can help speed up and simplify the coding process.
Code completion is a prediction tool. Syntax highlighting makes it easier to find syntax. Themes can change text and background color making it easier on the eyes. Extensions adds shortcuts and makes a text editor more intuitive. Default text editors like Notepad and Text Edit are able to make websites, but they lack the niceties of third-party text-editors like Visual Studio Code. All third-parties options are pretty similar so choosing one will be up to preference.

## The Command Line

Also referred to as a terminal, a command line lets you type and enter a command into a prompt which will tell the computer to complete a task. Some commands perform their task with zero feedback at all unless triggered by an error. Most commands have the display text right under the command entered. Depending on the shell within your terminal, a terminal will react a certain way.
