## Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

Without the basics of HTML, CSS & JS our webpages would have no structure, no visual appeal and they wouldn't even function correctly.

## Learn HTML

### 1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Semantics gives a heads up on what the role of the element is. Looking at a non-semantic element like span we aren't really sure what will happen when we use it. 

### 2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

In HTML there are 6 levels of headings: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. The largest is h1 and the smallest is h6.

### 3. What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

Some uses include marking up dates, math equations and forumulae. 

### 4. When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
