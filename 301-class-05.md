# Putting it all together

### 1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

A component should only do one thing. More complex components should be decomposed into smaller components.

### 2.What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

Building a version that takes data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity so no use of state.

### 3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

Identify which components mutate or utilize state

### 4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

* "Is it passed on from a parent via props?" 
* "Does it remain unchanged over time?"
*  "Can you compute it based on any other state or props in the component?"

### 5. How can you identify where state needs to live?

* Identify every component that renders something based on state
* Find a common parent component
* The common parent component should own state
* Worst case scenario add create a new component to hold state and add it above the common parent component.

### 1. What is a “higher-order function”?

A function that takes takes in other functions as arguments or returns them.

### 2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

Takes in n and returns a return boolean based on if m is greater than n.

### 3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

Map would apply the argument function to each element in the array.
