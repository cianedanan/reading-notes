## CSS Layout

Flexbox adds ease of use when lining elements up to achieve a certain layout.

### CSS Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox designed for elements that only move on an x axis. Flexbox lines up various elements with various sizes in the best way possible.  

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

"The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis." If flex-direction is column the cross axis will run left and right.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Only the visuals are affected with flexbox which causes problems with the logical order. A row-reversed nav bar will be flipped when trying to navigate through the links with arrow keys.
