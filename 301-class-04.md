# React and Forms

## 1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

Elements that maintain their own state and update based on user input.

## 2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

As soon as they enter so the user can see exactly what they're entering.

## 3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

By assigning a value to event.target.name

## 1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

It shortens if statements to one line so we would use it for cleaner code.

## 2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```JavaScript
let x = 0;
let y = 0;

(x === y) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
//expected output true 
```
