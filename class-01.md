<b>HTTP Poem</b> 

Do you know what happens when you enter an address? <br>
The client sends a request to grant us access.<br>
The client asks the server, "Could I have a copy of your website please?"<br>
If the server says okay, it sends back data packets with ease.<br> 
Knock knock. Who's there at the clients door?<br>
Small chunks have assembled to show what the client asked for.<br>
The webpage should now be fully in view,<br>
This all happens so quick within a second or two.<br>
